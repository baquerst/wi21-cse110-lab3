      <p>I’m a 4th year Cognitive Science: Design and Interaction student at
         <span style="color:blue">UCSD</span> with a Computer Science minor.

    <div>
      <p>Some of my favorite programming languages are listed below from most to least liked</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Java</li>
        <li>C</li>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>Python</li>
      </ol>
      <p>I ranked Java as my most liked programming language because of how familiar I am with it. 
        It was the first programming language I learned, so I feel I have the most knowledge in this language. Writing a main 
        method using <code>public static void main(String[] args)</code> feels natural to me because of how much time I spent 
        coding in Java.
      </p>
      <p>Right now, I have aspirations to become a UX designer or Front-end developer but I still have 
        <b>a lot</b> to learn and experience. Below is a list of the accomplishments I have achieved 
        and hope to achieve in the future.

      <h2 class="header">Personal Life</h2>
      <p>When I’m not studying or putting time into coding, I like to play video games and watch anime.</p>
      <p>Some games I enjoy playing include: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>League of Legends</li>
        <li>Valorant</li>
        <li>Genshin Impact</li>
      </ul>
      <p>One of my favorite animes I’ve watched, <i>NANA</i>, includes a quote from the protagonist Nana Osaki where she says</p>
      <pre><em>Don’t just give up. Life is about getting knocked down over and over, but still getting up each time. If you keep getting up, you win.</em></pre>
      
      <aside>This quote helps remind me that <strong>failures</strong> are a part of every process in life, and that it shouldn’t 
        discourage me but instead keep me <strong>motivated</strong> to reach my end goal.
      </aside>
      
      <p>I've also watched a lot of other animes and below you can see a table containing animes I would recommend and my rating of them.</p>

        <summary>Synopsis of Darling in the Franxx</summary>
        <p class="synopsis">Darling in the Franxx takes place in a dystopian post-apocalyptic future where the remnants of human civilization have abandoned the surface. Adults and children exist in contrasting environments from each other. Adults live in technologically-advanced cities within Plantations and are immortal, but procreation and relationships among them have become obsolete and undesirable. Artificially-created children, termed "parasites", are deprived of individuality and are educated only for piloting Franxx in pairs to defend humanity. The children are kept in isolation from adult society in environments nicknamed "birdcages", which emulate that of a bygone era, so that they can develop the emotional responses required to pilot Franxx.
          In the early 21st century, the progress of human civilization was accelerated by ground-breaking discoveries in mining technology, allowing extraction of magma energy for a new low-cost, all-encompassing energy source. Scientists contributing to the breakthrough form "APE", an organization that would gain a large influence on world politics and the global economy as a result of their discoveries. After discovering human immortality, much of mankind opted to become immortal despite the side effect of losing their reproductive functions. A cult of personality surrounds Papa, the chairman of the APE which all humans come to worship akin to a god. Now governing the remnants of civilization, APE leads humanity to abandon Earth's now desolate surface for the relative safety of mobile fortress-cities known as Plantations.</p>
